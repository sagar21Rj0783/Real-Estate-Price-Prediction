# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms,location, square footage, and more. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on these features

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes various features such as:

Number of bedrooms
Number of bathrooms
Square footage
Location
Area type
Society
Balcony
Availability

Data Preprocessing
Several data preprocessing steps were performed to prepare the dataset for modeling:

Data cleaning
Feature engineering
Outlier removal
Dimensionality reduction
One-hot encoding

Models
The following machine learning models were used in this project:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regressor

Results
The performance of each model was evaluated using Grid Search CV and cross-validation scores. The Linear Regression model provided the best results with the highest cross-validation score.
